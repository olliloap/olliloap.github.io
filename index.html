<h1>Selecting a Dataset for Analysis: </h1>
<p>I am a massive American Football fan and when watching Thursday Night Football there are overlays that use neural networks to predict blitzes. This helped me decide what type of data I would like to analyze for this project. Using Pro Football Reference and an open-source data scraper for python called nflscraPy I was able to collect all metadata and season data for every regular season game dating back to the year 2000. Unfortunately, all the data was split by season, so I had 24 different CSVs’. Using pandas and python I had to combine the metadata and season data into two large datasets that are sorted by the date the game was played. To do this, first I merged the metadata all into one large set, changed the date to be in an easier format to sort by, then sorted that dataset by its date from oldest to newest. I repeated this with the season datasets and ended with two larger datasets that contain the metadata from 2000-2023 and the season data from 2000-2023. With the two sorted datasets I can work on merging them together into one large set that I will use for my data analysis. To make the large dataset I take each sorted set and use a function in pandas called “merge” and chose to merge them by event_date and tm_market to make sure all the data lines up properly. Now I have a large dataset with every regular season game from 2000 to 2023.</p>

<h1>Hypotheses Before Data Analysis:</h1>
<p>
1.	Does winning the coin toss correlate to a greater chance of winning?
</p>
<div>Prediction: No, the coin toss should not change the outcome of a game considering all it changes is who gets the ball first and the direction the loser of the toss will start with.</div>
<p>2. Has home field advantage changed as time gone on? If so, why?</p>
<div>Prediction: I believe home field advantage will have not changed significantly throughout the seasons. This is because fans are just as passionate now as they were in the early 2000’s and I don’t believe the stadiums have filled more seats to lead to a greater home field advantage.</div>

<h1>Breakdown of Coin Toss Code:</h1>
<p>This code will create a two separate lists in python which contain all coin toss wins and losses for the winning team respectively. Using these lists and the total number of games it is possible to get the percentage of wins for each list. Then using matplotlib I create a pie chart.</p>
<h1>Analysis of Pie Chart:</h1>
<div><img src="https://i.imgur.com/lwVL40u.png"; width=350></div>
<p>Looking at the Pie chart it seems to be that winning a coin toss does lead to a few more wins. Although there are more wins, the margin of victory from winning and lossing is not significant. It is only slightly more likely than a regular coin flip and there may be other factors that come into play.</p>
<h1>Was my First Hypothesis Accurate?</h1>
<p>Somewhat, I do believe that a coin toss does not lead to a significant advantage however there is a larger margin of victory than I would have assumed before looking at the data.</p>

<h1>Breakdown of Home Field Advantage Code:</h1>
<p>First step to graphing the home field advantage is creating lists that are filled with only teams that were at home and also won. Using that list it is possible to take the total number of games and get a win percentage per season. The next step is getting the average attendance per season and the standardized attendance by dividing each average attendance by the highest average attenence. Getting this standardized attendance allows us to create a percentage that can be plotted along side the home field advantage in order to visualize any trends that may immerge. Alongside the standardized attendance we also remove the outlier of 2020 as there was a pandemic and stadiums could not fill seats.Third step is getting the linear regression line for the standardized attendance without the 2020 season and the home field advantage. Finally we create four graphs: Home Field Advantage with Trend Line, Standardized Average Attendance, Standardized Average Attendance without 2020 and with Trend Line, and a mixed chart with Standardized Attendance and the Home Field Advantage.</p>
<h1>All Charts for the Second Hypothesis:</h1>

<h1>Was my Second Hypothesis Correct?</h1>
<p>Home field advantage has steadily gone up as time is going on. It will never hit 100% because there are times an away team is the better team that day but there is clearly a strong advantage to being at home. I wanted to see if the average attendance has gone up and if that attendance is going up at a similar rate to the home field advantage. I checked this by first getting the average attendance for each season then dividing that by the largest average attendance to get a percentage that allows me to see how full the stadiums were on a given season. I had to remove the 2020 data for this attendance as it was an outlier due to the pandemic and stadiums not allowing fans in. When I graph the standardized average attendance without the 2020 season I can see a similar positive trend as the home field advantage. When the home field advantage is graphed on the same chart as the standardized average attendance, it helps showcase how the two are trending upward are similar rates. Although this is quite interesting, I do not know if the increase in average attendance is the cause for a stronger home field advantage. There is a strong case to be made that the fans can change the outcome of a game as any Chiefs or Seahawks fans will attest to. However, the first thing we learn in statistics is that correlation does not equal causation and there may be other factors that can cause a home team to win. Overall I do not believe my hypothesis was totally correct, there is a slight upward trend on the home field advantage as the years go on and that trend follows the line of best fit for the standardized average without the outlier.</p>
